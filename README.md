# Bypass-Teamlogger
A small, transparent utility that requests Windows not to enter idle sleep using the Win32 SetThreadExecutionState API. Intended for personal or team use on machines you control (presentations, long-running computations, media playback). This project does not simulate user input and must not be used to evade monitoring or logging.
